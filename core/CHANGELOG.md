# Changelog: lego-legacy-core

One heading per version, newest first. What each part of core's version means is in
[ADR-0007](../docs/adr/0007-every-crate-carries-its-own-version.md).

## 1.1.0 — 2026-10-18

Two backends joined, each written and compiled for its operating system and untested there:

- Windows (#107): a window through user32 and gdi32, the pointer by macOS's rules, and sound
  through winmm's `waveOut`, loaded from System32 at run time, with kernel32's `VirtualAlloc` and
  `LoadLibraryExW` beside `mmap` and `dlopen`. Compiles for x86-64 and Arm64 Windows.
- Linux (#108): an X11 window with the Mac's pointer rules and ALSA for sound, both reached by
  `dlopen`. Compiles for x86-64 and aarch64 Linux.

The pointer, pace and audio feed the backends share moved out of the Mac's into `host::pointer`,
`host::pace` and `host::feed`.

Fixed once the Linux backend was first run, on x86-64 and aarch64 under Xvfb (#108):

- A resized window's bars kept pieces of the frame drawn just before the backend was told the new
  size, since the X server only paints the background where a window is uncovered. The bars are
  now cleared at every frame.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-18

The engine the three v1 titles run on: an x86 and x87 interpreter for the guest's code, the Win32
and DirectX calls those titles make answered in Rust, a declared machine per title that the title
cannot see past, and a macOS host reached at run time with no external crates (ADR-0001). A run is
replayed from a route, logs what it did, and stops at a named wall when a title asks for something
the machine does not have.
